Hello, my name is __Kang Hyeon__ and I studied Computer Engineering at [Dongseo University](http://www.dongseo.ac.kr/)

Now Iâ€™m trying to be  __AI Solution Developer__ and so interested in AI, ML Algorithm.

I always love to muse "I wonder why?" by myself. Ah, Don't worry, I also really love to have a discussion about things interesting too!

If you happen to want to bring me to my senses, pls do that. Thank you and Regards :)
